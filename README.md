This project is the reworked and improved successor of [F1-Project](https://github.com/tamadam/f1-project). It's built with Next.js instead of plain React, taking advantage of all the features the framework offers — from server-side rendering to built-in routing and internationalization.

The previous app used the Ergast API, which is now deprecated. This version will rely on the next-gen alternative for F1 data.

Stay tuned — it's coming soon!
